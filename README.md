Hi, I'm akasak02, 
I'm currently studying Computer Science and I dream of working in Data Science.
Ever since I was a kid I have been fascinated by statistics, tables, graphs and most of all by finding patterns, and data science lies exactly at the intersection between my love for statistics, interest in economy and knowledge of computer science
Now I'm at the very beginning of my journey but I belive that with enough discipline I will make meaningful progress towards that goal over next year and everything will be documented here.

studying, working part-time and keeping up with the project isn't easy but I will be as consistant as I can.
